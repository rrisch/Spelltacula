## The most spectacular way for my kids to practice their spelling words

This is just a fun project for me to try out some new frameworks and keep my skill sharp while also trying to find new ways to make my kids study.  This is a simple web app that utilizes the built-in `SpeechSynthesis` technology in browsers to audiblly speak words to the user as a study aid / practice exam tool.

This project utilizes the following
- Vue 3 / Typescript / Vite
- Vue Router
- Pinia for state management
- Tailwind CSS / daisyUI
- Vue FontAwesome icons
